==============================================================================

A plugin to send code from a Neovim buffer to a running Neovim terminal by extending [vim-slime-ext-plugins](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime-ext-plugins/).

That plugin is itself a modification of [vim-slime](https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime) to move platform-specific functionality to extension plugins like this one.

Even though this documentation is for vim-slime-ext-neovim, it also reviews the functionality of `vim-slime-ext-plugins` and `vim-slime`

INTRODUCTION                                                *vim-slime-ext-neovim-introduction*

This is a plugin to send code from a Neovim buffer to a running Neovim 
terminal. This plugin extends |vim-slime-ext-plugins|, which is itself a 
modification of |vim-slime|. This documentation is specifically for 
vim-slime-ext-neovim but also reviews the functionality of vim-slime-ext-plugins 
and vim-slime.

Imagine you are testing quick changes to a Python script. One way to test 
changes is to copy and paste into an open Python REPL in a Neovim terminal. 
With this plugin, you can send the code directly to the REPL using Vim 
operator/motion+text object combinations.

For example, if |SlimeMotionSend| is mapped to 'gz', 'gzip' can send an 
uninterrupted block of text (a paragraph) to the REPL. This works for any 
program in the terminal accepting text input.

INSTALLATION                                                *vim-slime-ext-neovim-installation*

Note: vim-slime-ext-plugins is a required dependency.

Example installation and configuration using |lazy.nvim|:

>lua
{
'Klafyvel/vim-slime-ext-neovim',
dependencies = { "jpalardy/vim-slime-ext-plugins" },
init = function()
	vim.g.slime_no_mappings = true -- I prefer to turn off default mappings; see below for more details
	-- these next two are essential, telling vim-slime-ext-plugins to use the functions from this plugin
	vim.g.slime_target_send = "slime_neovim#send"
	vim.g.slime_target_config = "slime_neovim#config"
	vim.g.slime_input_pid = false -- use Neovim's internal Job ID rather than PID to select a terminal
	vim.g.override_status = true -- Show the Job ID and PID in the status bar of a terminal
	vim.g.ruled_status = true  -- If override_status is true, also show the cursor position in the status bar

	--mappings
	vim.keymap.set("n", "gz", "<Plug>SlimeMotionSend", { remap = true, silent = false })
	vim.keymap.set("n", "gzz", "<Plug>SlimeLineSend", { remap = true, silent = false })
	vim.keymap.set("x", "gz", "<Plug>SlimeRegionSend", { remap = true, silent = false })
end,
}
<

It's recommended to use `init` for setting global variables before the plugin 
loads; otherwise, they might not take effect.

Vimscript configuration is also possible:

>vim
    let g:slime_no_mappings = 1
    let g:slime_target_send = "slime_neovim#send"
    let g:slime_target_config = "slime_neovim#config"
    let g:slime_input_pid = 0
    let g:override_status = 1
    let g:ruled_status = 1
    map gz <Plug>SlimeMotionSend
    map gzz <Plug>SlimeLineSend
    xmap gz <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
<


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                       *vim-slime-ext-neovim-usage*

If `vim.g.slime_no_mappings = false`, default mappings will be defined. 
Specific default mappings will be disabled if the user provides their own.

Default mappings:

  - <C-c><C-c> : Send the current paragraph to the terminal
  - {Visual}<C-c><C-c> : Send highlighted text to the terminal
  - <C-c>v : Configure the target terminal

Additional plug mappings:

  - |<Plug>SlimeConfig| : Configure the terminal for the current buffer
  - |<Plug>SlimeRegionSend| : Send a visually selected region to the terminal
  - |<Plug>SlimeLineSend| : Send a line to the terminal
  - |<Plug>SlimeMotionSend| : Send text to the terminal based on motion/text-object
  - |<Plug>SlimeParagraphSend| : Send text to the terminal based on motion/text-object

Additional commands:

  - |:SlimeConfig| : Configure the terminal for the current buffer
  - |:SlimeSend| : Send a range of lines to the terminal. For example to send lines three through five to the terminal, `:3,5SlimeSend`.
  - |:SlimeSend1| : Send text to terminal, with a carriage return.  For example `:SlimeSend1 pwd`.
  - |:SlimeSend0| : Send text, wrapped in literal quotes, [;to terminal, without a carriage return.  For example `:SlimeSend0 'pwd'`  or  `:SlimeSend0 "pwd"`.

If you try to send text when no terminal is opened, you'll be prompted to 
open one. If multiple terminals are open, you're prompted with the most recently opened terminal, but can seledt any.

CONFIGURATION                                               *vim-slime-ext-neovim-configuration*

Global variables (`vim.g.xxx`) need to be created and set by the user. 
By default, they do not exist, which has the same effect as their being `false`.

Global variables are described in the next section.


==============================================================================
GLOBAL VARIABLES                                        *vim-slime-ext-neovim-global-variables*

1. *g:slime_no_mappings*

    When set to 1, default mappings are not created. This allows you to 
    define your own. Default is 0.

        let g:slime_no_mappings = 1

2. *g:slime_target_send*

    Specifies the function used for sending text to the terminal. Set to `slim_neovim#send` to use this plugin.

        let g:slime_target_send = "slime_neovim#send"

3. *g:slime_target_config*

    Specifies the function used for configuring the target terminal.  Set to `slim_neovim#config` to use this plugin.

        let g:slime_target_config = "slime_neovim#config"

4. *g:slime_input_pid*

    When set to 0, use |job-id| instead of system PID to selecct a terminal.

        let g:slime_input_pid = 0

    Note that PID is the identifier number that is used by the operating 
    system to manage running processes.

5. *g:override_status*

    When set to 1, overrides the status line of terminals to show the |job-id| and system PID.
    terminal.

        let g:override_status = 1

6. *g:ruled_status*

    When set to 1, displays rules in the status line to indicate the target
    terminal.

        let g:ruled_status = 1
